# Crosshair Overlay for Windows Systems

I've made this app has my C++ hobbie, this help me to learn some basics of C++ and understand a new language which I enjoy and think its usefull.

## Caracteristics && Future ideas

- This app can only overlay over **window boardless** games... I don't think is that hard to hook this app to other app, indeed doing it without triggering other systems is what I want to understand.

- What I invision is an app that will hook to any other DLL that its allowed, this app will have an initial prompt that will let you choose which app to target, just like a screen recorder. Has this app doesnt read or write memory from other apps, it shouldn't be a problem. Doing it like a ninja is just a fun way to send myself into a path of learning new stuff.

- The code is free to use has I've follow along tutorials on youtube to build this app. 

- I've made this with the objective of having a target to keep me focus while playing FPS games, has most games will send the projectiles to the middle of the screen.

- The crosshair has a square or circle that you can use to define the hip fire FOV/Spread which helps to keep the target centered when hip fire

- Color tune and oppacity

- Circle , Square or Only Corners

- Line thickness tune for all aspects
